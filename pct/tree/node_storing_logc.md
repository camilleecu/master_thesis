At the root node (level 0) of your tree in Yahootree.py, the node should contain both ItemA and ItemB—typically as a tuple or as two separate attributes—since the split at this node is defined by the user's preference between these two items[1].

### What Should the Node Store at Each Level?

- **At the root (level 0):**  
  The node should store the pair (ItemA, ItemB), representing the items used to split the users at this level[1].
- **After the split (level 1):**  
  Each child node at level 1 will be responsible for a subset of users (e.g., those who preferred ItemA, those who preferred ItemB, and possibly an "unknown" group).  
  **Crucially:**  
  - The value stored in each node at level 1 should correspond to the *next* pair of items chosen to split that group, not the previous pair or the group label[1].
  - The node's stored value should always represent the *pair of items used for splitting at that node*, regardless of which group of users it contains.

### How Does This Influence Recursive Tree Building?

- **Recursive logic:**  
  At every recursive call (i.e., at each new node), the algorithm selects the best new pair of items for that specific subset of users and stores that pair in the node[1].
- **Node content is always about the split, not the group:**  
  The node does *not* store which group it represents (e.g., "users who preferred ItemA at the previous split"), but rather which pair of items it is using to split its current users[1].
- **Tree structure:**  
  - At each level, the node contains the pair of items used for splitting at that level.
  - The recursive build continues, with each child node independently selecting and storing its own best pair for splitting its subset of users.

### Example

Suppose you start with 6 users at the root, splitting on (ItemA, ItemB):

- **Root node (level 0):**  
  - Stores: (ItemA, ItemB)
  - Users split into three groups:  
    - Group A (prefers ItemA): 4 users  
    - Group B (prefers ItemB): 2 users  
    - (Possibly) Group Unknown

- **Level 1 nodes (children of root):**  
  - Each node receives its group of users.
  - For each node, the algorithm selects a *new* best pair of items (say, (ItemC, ItemD) for Group A, (ItemE, ItemF) for Group B, etc.).
  - Each node at level 1 stores the pair it uses to split its own users, not the pair from the parent or the group label[1].

### Summary Table

| Level      | Node Content             | Represents                |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0 (root)   | (ItemA, ItemB)           | Split on ItemA vs ItemB   |
| 1 (child)  | (ItemC, ItemD) (example) | Split on ItemC vs ItemD   |
| 2 (child)  | (ItemG, ItemH) (example) | Split on ItemG vs ItemH   |

### Key Point

> At every node, store the pair of items used for splitting *at that node*, regardless of which group of users the node contains. This ensures the recursive tree building process is consistent and each split is clearly defined by the items used at that level[1].

This approach is consistent with the recursive build logic in Yahootree.py, where each node is defined by the pair of items it uses to split its users, and the process repeats independently for each child node[1].
